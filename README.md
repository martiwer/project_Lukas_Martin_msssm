> * Project Title: The influence of a speed limit reduction on a traffic jam

## General Introduction

Traffic jam is getting more and more a problem. The number of cars is increasing every day and the time wasted stuck in traffic is annoying everyone of us.
There's a lot of effort to prevent traffic jams. One notice on swiss highways a speed limit reduction when the traffic is overloaded.
We want to model the effect of the speed limit reduction and see if this method improves the traffic flow.


## The Model

We model a section of a Highway with a high traffic density or even a traffic jam. 



## Fundamental Questions

Analyze the influence of diffrent speed limits to the traffic flow.
Is it possible to improve the traffic flow with a speed limit reduction?
Can one even prevent a traffic jam with a speed limit reduction?
What is the ideal speed limit?
How does the propagation of traffic jam change with diffrent speed limits?



## Expected Results

Because this method of reducing the speed limit is actually in use, we hope our model can prove a positive effect on the traffic flow.
